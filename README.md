# Assembly Code Bug: Potential Memory Access Violation

This repository demonstrates a potential memory access violation bug in a small piece of assembly code. The code attempts to access memory at an address calculated from registers without verifying the address's validity. This can lead to segmentation faults and program crashes.

## Bug Description
The `mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]` instruction calculates a memory address based on the values of `ebx`, `ecx`, and a constant offset. If the result of this calculation falls outside the program's allocated memory space or attempts to access protected memory, it causes a crash.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves adding explicit bounds checking before accessing memory.  This ensures that the calculated address is within the allowed range, preventing memory access violations.

## How to reproduce
1. Assemble and link the code in `bug.asm`.
2. Run the resulting executable.  It may crash depending on the initial values of the registers.
